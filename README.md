# Fake News Detection

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements **Fake News Detection** using two different models:
1. **Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorization**
2. **LSTM Neural Network**

Both models are trained on a Kaggle dataset for fake news detection and evaluated to compare their performance.

## üìÇ Dataset
We use a dataset containing real and fake news articles. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets before feeding into the models.

- **True.csv** ‚Üí Contains legitimate news articles.
- **Fake.csv** ‚Üí Contains fake news articles.
- Labels:
  - `1` ‚Üí Real news
  - `0` ‚Üí Fake news

## üõ† Models & Training
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)**
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert text into numerical features.
- Trained using **Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression**.
- Achieved **99% accuracy** on test data.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abinet-Cholo/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```
2. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Logistic Regression Model:**

## üìä Model Comparison
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 99% | 99% | 99% | 99% |
| **LSTM** | 91.29% | 92% | 92% | 91% |

- **Logistic Regression** performed **better** overall, achieving near-perfect accuracy.
- **LSTM** is still effective but might require more tuning (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, more epochs, or different architectures).
